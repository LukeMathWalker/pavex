    # The --locked flag can be used to force Cargo to use the packaged Cargo.lock file if it is available.
    # This may be useful for ensuring reproducible builds, to use the exact same set of dependencies that were available when the package was published.
    # It may also be useful if a newer version of a dependency is published that no longer builds on your system, or has other problems
