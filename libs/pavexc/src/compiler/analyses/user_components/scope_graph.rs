/// Assign a unique ID to each *scope*.
///
/// All components are assigned to a scope.
/// Scopes can be user-defined (e.g. a `nest` call) or implicit (e.g. the root scope,
/// the scope for each request handler and the scope for the application state).
///
/// "Normal" scopes have a single parent scope and zero or more child scopes.
/// The root scope has no parent scope and zero or more child scopes.
/// The application state scope has multiple parent scopes and no child scopes.
/// Each request handler has a dedicated scope with no children—this allows us to register
/// components that are only visible to the call graph of a specific request handler.
///
/// All the components in a scope are visible to all the components in the scope's subgraph.
