/// use pavex_runtime::extract::route::RawRouteParams;
///
/// # fn main() {
/// let mut bp = Blueprint::new();
/// // [...]
/// // Register a route with a few route parameters.
/// bp.route(GET, "/address/:address_id/home/:home_id", f!(crate::get_home));

///
/// `RawRouteParams` is a framework primitive—you don't need to register any constructor
/// with `Blueprint` to use it in your application.
///
/// # What does "raw" mean?
///
/// Route parameters are URL segments, therefore they must comply with the restrictions that apply
/// to the URL itself. In particular, they can only use ASCII characters.  
/// In order to support non-ASCII characters, route parameters are
/// [percent-encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP).  
/// If you want to send "123 456" as a route parameter, you have to percent-encode it: it becomes
/// "123%20456" since "%20" is the percent-encoding for a space character.
///
/// `RawRouteParams` gives you access to the **raw** route parameters, i.e. the route parameters
/// as they are extracted from the URL, before any kind of processing has taken
/// place.
///
/// In particular, `RawRouteParams` does **not** perform any percent-decoding.  
/// If you send a request to `/address/123%20456/home/789`, the `RawRouteParams` for
/// `/address/:address_id/home/:home_id` will contain the following key-value pairs:
///
/// - `address_id`: `123%20456`
/// - `home_id`: `789`
///
/// `address_id` is not `123 456` because `RawRouteParams` does not perform percent-decoding!
/// Therefore `%20` is not interpreted as a space character.
///
/// There are situations where you might want to work with the raw route parameters, but
/// most of the time you'll want to use [`RouteParams`] instead—it performs percent-decoding
/// and deserialization for you.

///
/// # Unsupported types
///
/// `pavex` wants to enable local reasoning, whenever possible: it should be easy to understand what
/// each extracted route parameter represents.  
/// Plain structs with named fields are ideal in this regard: by looking at the field name you can
/// immediately understand _which_ route parameter is being extracted.  
/// The same is not true for other types, e.g. `(String, u64, u32)`, where you have to go and
/// check the route's path template to understand what each entry represents.
/// For this reason, `pavex` does not support the following types as `T` in `RouteParams<T>`:
///
/// - tuples, e.g. `(u32, String)`;
/// - tuple structs, e.g. `struct HomeId(u32, String)`;
/// - unit structs, e.g. `struct HomeId`;
/// - newtypes, e.g. `struct HomeId(MyParamsStruct)`;
/// - sequence-like or map-like types, e.g. `Vec<String>` or `HashMap<String, String>`;
/// - enums.
///
/// # Working with raw route parameters
///
/// It is possible to work with the **raw** route parameters, i.e. the route parameters as they
/// are extracted from the URL, before any kind of percent-decoding or deserialization has taken
/// place.
///
/// You can do so by using the [`RawRouteParams`] extractor instead of [`RouteParams`]. Check out
/// [`RawRouteParams`]' documentation for more information.
