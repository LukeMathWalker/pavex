/// All components are assigned to a scope.
/// Scopes can be user-defined (e.g. a `nest` call) or implicit (e.g. the root scope,
/// the scope for each request handler and the scope for the application state).
///
/// "Normal" scopes have a single parent scope and zero or more child scopes.
/// The root scope has no parent scope and zero or more child scopes.
/// The application state scope has multiple parent scopes and no child scopes.
/// Each request handler has a dedicated scope with the application state scope as its only child.
///
/// All the components in a scope are visible to all the components in the scope's subgraph.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```text
///       +---------------------+
///       |        Root         |
