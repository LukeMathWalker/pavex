//! # Pavex - API reference
//!
//! Welcome to the API reference for Pavex!
//!
//! The API reference is fairly low-level.  
//! If you want a high-level overview of Pavex, check out the [documentation](https://pavex.dev/docs/)
//! on Pavex's website.  
//! You'll also find [an installation guide](https://pavex.dev/docs/getting_started/) as well as a
//! [quickstart tutorial](https://pavex.dev/docs/getting_started/quickstart/)
//! to get you up and running with the framework in no time.

// Re-export the dependencies that we use in the generated application code.
