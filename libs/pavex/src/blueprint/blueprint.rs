    /// # Routing: an introduction
    ///
    /// ## Simple routes
    ///
    /// The simplest route is a combination of a single HTTP method, a path and a request handler:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use pavex::{f, blueprint::{Blueprint, router::GET}};
    /// use pavex::{request::RequestHead, response::Response};
    ///
    /// fn my_handler(request_head: &RequestHead) -> Response {
    ///     // [...]
    ///     # todo!()
    /// }
    ///
    /// # fn main() {
    /// let mut bp = Blueprint::new();
    /// bp.route(GET, "/path", f!(crate::my_handler));
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// You can use the constants exported in the [`router`] module to specify one of the well-known
    /// HTTP methods:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use pavex::f;
    /// use pavex::blueprint::{Blueprint, router::{GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH}};
    /// # use pavex::{request::RequestHead, response::Response};
    /// # fn my_handler(request: &RequestHead) -> Response { todo!() }
    /// # fn main() {
    /// # let mut bp = Blueprint::new();
    ///
    /// bp.route(GET, "/path", f!(crate::my_handler));
    /// bp.route(POST, "/path", f!(crate::my_handler));
    /// bp.route(PUT, "/path", f!(crate::my_handler));
    /// bp.route(DELETE, "/path", f!(crate::my_handler));
    /// bp.route(PATCH, "/path", f!(crate::my_handler));
    /// // ...and a few more!
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Matching multiple HTTP methods
    ///
    /// It can also be useful to register a request handler that handles multiple HTTP methods
    /// for the same path:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use pavex::blueprint::{Blueprint, router::{MethodGuard, POST, PATCH}};
    /// use pavex::f;
    /// use pavex::http::Method;
    /// # use pavex::{request::RequestHead, response::Response};
    /// # fn my_handler(request: &RequestHead) -> Response { todo!() }
    /// # fn main() {
    /// # let mut bp = Blueprint::new();
    ///
    /// // `crate::my_handler` will be used to handle both `PATCH` and `POST` requests to `/path`
    /// bp.route(
    ///     MethodGuard::new([Method::PATCH, Method::POST]),
    ///     "/path",
    ///     f!(crate::my_handler)
    /// );
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Last but not least, you can register a route that matches a request **regardless** of
    /// the HTTP method being used:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use pavex::f;
    /// use pavex::blueprint::{Blueprint, router::ANY};
    /// # use pavex::{request::RequestHead, response::Response};
    /// # fn my_handler(request: RequestHead) -> Response { todo!() }
    /// # fn main() {
    /// # let mut bp = Blueprint::new();
    ///
    /// // This will match **all** incoming requests to `/path`, regardless of their HTTP method.
    /// // `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`... anything goes!
    /// bp.route(ANY, "/path", f!(crate::my_handler));
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Route parameters
    ///
    /// Your route paths can include **route parameters**—a way to bind the
    /// value of a path segment from an incoming request and make it available to your request
    /// handler.
    ///
    /// Let's look at an example—a route with a single route parameter, `home_id`:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use pavex::{f, blueprint::{Blueprint, router::GET}};
    /// # use pavex::{request::RequestHead, response::Response};
    /// # fn get_home(request: RequestHead) -> Response { todo!() }
    /// # fn main() {
    /// # let mut bp = Blueprint::new();
    ///
    /// // This route will match `GET` requests to `/home/123` and `/home/456`, but not `/home`.
    /// bp.route(GET, "/home/:home_id", f!(crate::get_home));
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Route parameters are path segments prefixed with a colon (`:`)—`:home_id` in the example.  
    /// The value of the route parameter `home_id` can then be retrieved from the request handler
    /// (or any other constructor that has access to the request):
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use pavex::extract::route::RouteParams;
    ///
    /// #[RouteParams]
    /// struct HomeRouteParams {
    ///     // The name of the field must match the name of the route parameter
    ///     // used in the template we passed to `bp.route`.
    ///     home_id: u32,
    /// }
    ///
    /// // The `RouteParams` extractor will deserialize the route parameters into the
    /// // type you specified—`HomeRouteParams` in this case.
    /// fn get_home(params: &RouteParams<HomeRouteParams>) -> String {
    ///     format!("Fetching the home with id {}", params.0.home_id)
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Pavex supports **catch-all** parameters as well: they start with `*` and match
    /// everything after the `/`.
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use pavex::{f, blueprint::{Blueprint, router::GET}};
    /// # use pavex::{request::RequestHead, response::Response};
    /// # fn get_town(request: RequestHead) -> Response { todo!() }
    /// # fn main() {
    /// # let mut bp = Blueprint::new();
    ///
    /// // This route will match, for example, `GET` requests to:
    /// // - `/town/123`, with `town_info=123`
    /// // - `/town/456/street/123`, with `town_info=456/street/123`
    /// //
    /// // It won't match a GET request to `/town/`, `town_info` cannot be empty.
    /// bp.route(GET, "/town/:*town_info", f!(crate::get_town));
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///

    /// it **must** be at the end of the route template
