    /// We use the concept of application profiles to allow for

    /// the application is running in.
    ///
    /// We don't rely on `figment`'s built-in support for profiles because
    /// we want to make sure that values for different profiles are not co-located in
    /// the same configuration file.  
    /// This makes it easier to avoid leaking sensitive information by mistake (e.g.
    /// by committing configuration values for the `dev` profile to the repository).
    ///
    /// Your primary mechanism to specify the desired application profile is the `APP_PROFILE`
    /// environment variable.
    /// You can pass a `default_profile` value that will be used if the environment variable
    /// is not set.
    ///
    /// # Hierarchy
    ///
    /// The configuration sources are:
    ///
    /// 1. `base.yml` - The default configuration values, common to all profiles.
    /// 2. `<profile>.yml` - Configuration values specific to the desired profile.
    /// 3. Environment variables - Configuration values specific to the current environment.
    ///
    /// The configuration sources are listed in priority order, i.e.
    /// the last source in the list will override any previous source.
    ///
    /// For example, if the same configuration key is defined in both
    /// the YAML file and the environment, the value from the environment
    /// will be used.
    ///
    /// # Environment variables
    ///
    /// You can use environment variables to override every single configuration value.
    ///
    /// All config-related environment variables must be prefixed with `APP_`.
    /// The prefix tries to minimise the chance of a collision with unrelated environment
    /// variables that might be set on the host where the application is launched.
    ///
    /// After the `APP_` prefix, you must concatenate the names of the fields that must
    /// be traversed (starting from [`AppConfig`]) to reach the configuration value you want to
    /// override.
    ///
    /// E.g. `APP_SERVER__PORT` for [`ServerConfig::port`] since, to reach it, you go through:
    ///
    /// - the `server` field in [`AppConfig`]
    /// - the `port` field in [`ServerConfig`]
    ///
    /// We make an exception for [`AppConfig::app`].
    /// You can use `APP_` as prefix for its subfields rather than `APP_APP__*`.
