//! This is a temporary stop-gap solution to allow us to publish Pavex to crates.io
//! without giving everyone access.  
//! The "secret" product key is available in Pavex's Discord server for every person that's
//! of the beta.
//! That's why we just check a SHA2 hash of the key rather than doing something more robust
//! with `argon2` or `bcrypt`.
//!
//! In the future we'll migrate to a more robust solution, with per-user keys,
//! validation checks against a server at most once every X hours, etc.
//! But this will do for now.
