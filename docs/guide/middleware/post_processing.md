# Post-processing

Post-processing middlewares are invoked after the request handler.  
They are suitable for modifying the response and/or performing side-effects based on its contents.
E.g. logging the response's status code, injecting response headers, etc.

## Registration

You register a post-processing middleware against a blueprint via the [`post_process`](crate::blueprint::Blueprint::post_process) method.

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/middleware/post/project-registration.snap"

You must provide an **[unambiguous path]** to the middleware, wrapped in the [`f!`][f] macro.  

The middleware will be invoked for all request handlers registered after it, as long as they were registered against the same [`Blueprint`][Blueprint]
or one of its nested children.
Check out the [scoping section](scoping.md) for more details.

!!! note "Registration syntax"

    You can use free functions, static methods, non-static methods, and trait methods as middlewares.
    Check out the [dependency injection cookbook](../dependency_injection/cookbook.md) for more details on
    the syntax for each case.


## `IntoResponse`

Post-processing middlewares, like request handlers, must return a type that can be converted into a [`Response`][Response] via the
[`IntoResponse`][IntoResponse] trait.  
If you want to return a custom type from your middleware, you must implement [`IntoResponse`][IntoResponse] for it.

## Middlewares can fail

Post-processing middlewares can be fallible, i.e. they can return a [`Result`][Result].

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/middleware/post/project-fallible.snap"

If they do, you must specify an [**error handler**](../errors/error_handlers.md) when registering them:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/middleware/post/project-registration_with_error_handler.snap"

Check out the [error handling guide](../errors/error_handlers.md) for more details.


## Dependency injection

Post-processing middlewares can take advantage of **dependency injection**.

You must specify the dependencies of your middleware as **input parameters** in its function signature.  
Those inputs are going to be built and injected by the framework, according to the **constructors** you have registered.

Post-processing middlewares, like request handlers and pre-processing middlewares,
can **mutate request-scoped types**.
Ask for a `&mut` reference to the type you want to mutate as an input parameter, the framework will take care of the rest.

Check out the [dependency injection guide](../dependency_injection/index.md) for more details
on how the process works.  
Check out the [request data guide](../request_data/index.md) for an overview of the data you can extract from the request
using Pavex's first-party extractors.
