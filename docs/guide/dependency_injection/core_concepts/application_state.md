# `ApplicationState`

All the [`Singleton`][Lifecycle::Singleton] types that your application needs to access at runtime
when processing a request are grouped together in a struct called [`ApplicationState`][ApplicationState].  
The [`ApplicationState`][ApplicationState] is code-generated by Pavex:
you don't have to write it yourself!

It is defined in the [server SDK crate] and exported as a public type.  
It is then used in the [server crate] as an input parameter
to the [`run` function](../../project_structure/index.md#run),
the one that launches the HTTP server to start listening for incoming requests.

## Singleton dependencies

Constructors for [`Singleton`][Lifecycle::Singleton] types are invoked before the application starts,
in the generated [`build_application_state`][build_application_state] function.

[`ApplicationState`][ApplicationState] is designed to be minimal: it only includes the types that are needed **at runtime**.  
If a [`Singleton`][Lifecycle::Singleton] type is only needed to build another [`Singleton`][Lifecycle::Singleton] type,
it won't be included in the [`ApplicationState`][ApplicationState].
It will be constructed in [`build_application_state`][build_application_state] and then discarded.

If [`Singleton`][Lifecycle::Singleton] type `A` is needed to build [`Singleton`][Lifecycle::Singleton] type `B`,
you don't _have to_ register a constructor for `A`.  
Pavex will change the signature of [`build_application_state`][build_application_state] to require `A` as input parameter:
you're then free to build `A` however you want in the [server crate].
