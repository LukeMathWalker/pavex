# Kits

Pavex provides a [rich set of first-party constructors](../../request_data/index.md).  
To leverage them, you must register them with your application's [`Blueprint`][Blueprint]: after a while,
it gets tedious.  
To make your life easier, Pavex provides **kits**: collections of commonly used constructors, 
organized by application type.  

## `ApiKit`

[`ApiKit`][ApiKit] is a good starting point for most APIs and it's installed by default in projects created with
`pavex new`.  

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/dependency_injection/kit/project-default_kit.snap"

It registers constructors for:

- [`PathParams`][PathParams]
- [`QueryParams`][QueryParams]
- [`BufferedBody`][BufferedBody]
- [`BodySizeLimit`][BodySizeLimit]
- [`JsonBody`][JsonBody]

## Customization

Using a kit it's not an all-or-nothing deal: you can cherry-pick the constructors you need and
even customize them.

### Skip a constructor

If you don't need a particular constructor, you can skip its registration by setting the corresponding
kit field to `None`:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/dependency_injection/kit/project-skip.snap"

### Tweak a constructor

In other cases, you may want to include a constructor, but the default configuration doesn't fit your requirements.  
For example, you might want to change the cloning behavior or the associated error handler.  

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/dependency_injection/kit/project-tweak.snap"

### Replace a constructor

You can also replace one of the constructors provided by the kit with a custom one.  

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/dependency_injection/kit/project-replace.snap"

1. When working with a kit,
   you configure the constructor _without_ registering it directly with the blueprint.  
   The kit takes care of the registration for you when its `register` method is invoked.
