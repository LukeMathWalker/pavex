# Low-level access

[`BufferedBody`][BufferedBody] is Pavex's main interface to work with the bytes of the incoming request body.

[`BufferedBody`][BufferedBody] consumes the [raw byte stream](../wire_data.md#rawincomingbody) and 
buffers the entire body of the incoming request in memory.  
At the same time, it takes care of enforcing [sane limits](#body-size-limit) to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

## Registration

To use [`BufferedBody`][BufferedBody] in your project, you need to register a constructor for it.
You can use [`BufferedBody::register`][BufferedBody::register] to register its default constructor 
and error handler:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/buffered_body/project-installation.snap"

1. You also need to register a constructor for [`BodySizeLimit`][BodySizeLimit]!

## Use cases

[`BufferedBody`][BufferedBody] is the ideal building block for other extractors that need to have the entire body 
available in memory to do their job (e.g. [`JsonBody`][JsonBody]).

[`BufferedBody`][BufferedBody] is also a good fit if you need to access the raw bytes of the 
body ahead of deserialization (e.g. to compute its hash as a step of a signature verification process).
In those scenarios, make sure to inject a shared reference to [`BufferedBody`][BufferedBody] (i.e. `&BufferedBody`)
into your component rather than consuming it (i.e. `BufferedBody`).

## Body size limit

[BufferedBody] enforces an upper limit on the body size to prevent [resource exhaustion attacks](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa4-unrestricted-resource-consumption/). 
The default limit is 2 MBs.  
[BufferedBody::extract] returns [SizeLimitExceeded] if the limit is exceeded.

### Custom limit

You can customize the limit by registering a custom constructor for [BodySizeLimit] in your [Blueprint]:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/buffered_body/project-custom_limit.snap"

### No limit

You can also disable the limit altogether:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/buffered_body/project-no_limit.snap"

### Granular limits

In large applications with many routes it can be hard
(if not impossible) to find a single limit that works for all routes.
You can leverage nesting to define more granular limits.
