# Json

[`JsonBody<T>`][JsonBody] buffers the body in memory and deserializes it as JSON, 
according to the type `T` you specify.  

## Registration

To use [`JsonBody<T>`][JsonBody] in your application you need to register a constructor for it.  
You can use [`JsonBody::register`][JsonBody::register] to register the default constructor
and error handler:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/json/project-installation.snap"

1. You also need to register a constructor for [`BufferedBody`][BufferedBody]!  
   Check out the [BufferedBody guide](../byte_wrappers.md) for more details.

## Extraction 

Inject [`JsonBody<T>`][JsonBody] as an input in your components to access the parsed body:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/json/project-extraction.snap"

## Deserialization

The newly defined struct must be **deserializable**—i.e. it must implement the [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] trait.  
You can derive [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] in most cases.

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/json/project-struct_with_attr.snap"

## Avoiding allocations

If you want to minimize memory usage, you can try to avoid unnecessary heap memory allocations when deserializing 
string-like fields from the body of the incoming request.
Pavex supports this use case—**you can borrow from the request body**.

### Escape sequences

It is not always possible to avoid allocations, though.
In particular,
Pavex must allocate a new `String` if the JSON string you are trying to deserialize contains escape sequences,
such as `\n` or a `\"`.
Using a `&str` in this case would result in a runtime error when attempting the deserialization.

### Cow

We recommend using [`Cow<'_, str>`][Cow] as your field type for string-like parameters.
It borrows from the request's body if possible, it allocates a new `String` if it can't be avoided.

[`Cow<'_, str>`][Cow] strikes a balance between performance and robustness: you don't have to worry about a runtime error 
if the field contains escape sequences, but you tried to use `&str` as its field type.
