# Path parameters

In REST APIs, the [path](index.md) is often used to identify a resource.  
For example, in `https://example.com/users/123`, the path is `/users/123` and the resource is the user with ID `123`.

Those dynamic path segments are called **path parameters**.  
In Pavex, you must declare the path parameters for a given path in the route definition—see [Path parameters](../../routing/path_patterns.md#route-parameters)
for more details.
You then use [`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] to extract the parameters from the incoming request.

## Registration

To use [`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] in your application you need to register a constructor for it.  
You can use [`PathParams::register`][PathParams::register] to register its default constructor
and error handler:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_installation.snap"

## Overview

Let's keep using `https://example.com/users/123` as an example.  
To extract `123` from the path, you register `/users/:id` as the path pattern for that route.

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_registration.snap"

1. The path pattern for the route.

You can then access the `id` value for an incoming request by injecting [`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] in your handler:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_extraction.snap"

There are a few moving parts here. Let's break them down!

### Fields names

[`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] is a generic wrapper around a struct[^why-struct] that models the path parameters for a given path.  
All struct fields must be named after the path parameters declared in the path pattern[^wrong-name].

In our example, the path pattern is `/users/:id`.
Our extraction type, `GetUserParams`, must have a matching field named `id`.

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_struct.snap"

### Deserialization

The newly defined struct must be **deserializable**—i.e. it must implement the [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] trait.  
The [`#[PathParams]`][PathParamsMacro] attribute macro will automatically derive [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] for you. Alternatively, you can derive or implement [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] directly.

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_struct_with_attr.snap"

If you rely on [`#[PathParams]`][PathParamsMacro], Pavex can perform more advanced checks at compile time[^structural-deserialize] (e.g. detect unsupported types).

### Parsing

From a protocol perspective, all path parameters are strings.  
From an application perspective, you might want to enforce stricter constraints.

In our example, we expect `id` parameter to be a number.  
We could set the field type for `id` to `String` and then parse it into a number in the handler; however, that's going
to get tedious if we need to do it every single time we want to work with a numeric path parameter.  
We can skip all that boilerplate by setting the field type to `u64` directly, and let Pavex do the parsing for us:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_typed_field.snap"

Everything works as expected because `u64` implements the [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] trait.

### Unsupported field types

Path parameters are best used to encode **values**, such as numbers, strings, or dates.  
There is no standard way to encode more complex types such as collections (e.g. `Vec<T>`, tuples) in a path parameter.
As a result, Pavex doesn't support them.

Pavex will do its best to catch unsupported types at compile time, but it's not always possible.

## Avoiding allocations

If you want to squeeze out the last bit of performance from your application,
you can try to avoid heap memory allocations when extracting string-like path parameters.  
Pavex supports this use case—**you can borrow from the request's path**.

### Percent-encoding

It is not always possible to avoid allocations when handling path parameters.  
Path parameters must comply with the restriction of the URI specification:
you can only use [a limited set of characters](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2).  
If you want to use a character not allowed in a URI, you must [percent-encode it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding).  
For example, if you want to use a space in a path parameter, you must encode it as `%20`.
A string like `John Doe` becomes `John%20Doe` when percent-encoded.

[`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] automatically decodes percent-encoded strings for you. But that comes at a cost:
Pavex _must_ allocate a new `String` if the path parameter is percent-encoded.

### Cow

We recommend using [`Cow<'_, str>`][Cow] as your field type for string-like parameters.
It borrows from the request's path if possible, it allocates a new `String` if it can't be avoided.

[`Cow<'_, str>`][Cow] strikes a balance between performance and robustness:
you don't have to worry about a runtime error if the path parameter
is percent-encoded, but you tried to use `&str` as its field type.

## Design considerations

Pavex wants to enable local reasoning. It should be easy to understand what
each extracted path parameter represents.  
Structs with named fields are ideal in this regard: by looking at the field name you can
immediately understand _which_ path parameter is being extracted.  
The same is not true for other types, e.g. `(String, u64, u32)`, where you have to go and
check the route's path pattern to understand what each entry represents.

```rust
use pavex::request::path::PathParams;

// This is self-documenting ✅
// No need to check the route's path pattern to understand what each field represents.
#[PathParams]
pub struct Room {
    home_id: u32,
    room_id: u32,
    street_id: u32,
}

pub fn get_room(params: &PathParams<Room>) -> String {
    // [...]
}

// This isn't self-documenting ❌
// What does the second u32 represent? The room id? The street id?
// Impossible to tell without checking the route's path template.
pub fn get_room_tuple(params: &PathParams<(u32, u32, u32)>) -> String {
    // [...]
}
```

For this reason, Pavex does not support the following types as `T` in [`PathParams<T>`][PathParams]:

- tuples, e.g. `(u32, String)`
- tuple structs, e.g. `struct HomeId(u32, String)`
- unit structs, e.g. `struct HomeId`
- newtypes, e.g. `struct HomeId(MyParamsStruct)`
- sequence-like or map-like types, e.g. `Vec<String>` or `HashMap<String, String>`
- enums

[^why-struct]: Pavex made a deliberate choice of _not_ supporting tuples or other sequence-like types for extracting path parameters.
Check out [the API reference](../../../api_reference/pavex/request/path/struct.PathParams.html#unsupported-types)
to learn more about the rationale behind this decision.

[^wrong-name]: If a field name doesn't match a path parameter name, Pavex will detect it at compile time and return
an error.
No more runtime errors because you misspelled a field name!

[^structural-deserialize]: Check the documentation for [`StructuralDeserialize`][StructuralDeserialize] if you want
to know more about the underlying mechanism.
