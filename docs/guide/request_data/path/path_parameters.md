# Path parameters

In REST APIs, the [path](index.md) is often used to identify a resource.  
For example, in `https://example.com/users/123`, the path is `/users/123` and the resource is the user with ID `123`.

Those dynamic path segments are called **path parameters**.  
In Pavex, you must declare the path parameters for a given path in the route definition—see [Path parameters](../../routing/path_patterns.md#route-parameters)
for more details.

## Overview

Let's keep using `https://example.com/users/123` as an example.  
To extract `123` from the path, you register `/users/:id` as the path pattern for that route.

1. The path pattern for the route.

You can then access the `id` value for an incoming request by injecting [`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] in your handler:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_extraction.snap"

There are a few moving parts here. Let's break them down!

### Fields names

[`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] is a generic wrapper around a struct[^why-struct] that models the path parameters for a given path.  
All struct fields must be named after the path parameters declared in the path pattern[^wrong-name].

In our example, the path pattern is `/users/:id`.
Our extraction type, `GetUserParams`, must have a matching field named `id`.

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_struct.snap"

### Deserialization

The newly defined struct must be **deserializable**—i.e. it must implement the [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] trait.  
The [`#[PathParams]`][PathParamsMacro] attribute macro will automatically derive [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] for you. Alternatively, you can derive or implement [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] directly.

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_struct_with_attr.snap"

If you rely on [`#[PathParams]`][PathParamsMacro], Pavex can perform more advanced checks at compile time[^structural-deserialize] (e.g. detect unsupported types).

### Parsing

From a protocol perspective, all path parameters are strings.  
From an application perspective, you might want to enforce stricter constraints.

In our example, we expect `id` parameter to be a number.  
We could set the field type for `id` to `String` and then parse it into a number in the handler; however, that's going
to get tedious if we need to do it every single time we want to work with a numeric route parameter.  
We can skip all that boilerplate by setting the field type to `u64` directly, and let Pavex do the parsing for us:

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-route_params_typed_field.snap"

Everything works as expected because `u64` implements the [`serde::Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] trait.

### Unsupported field types

Path parameters are best used to encode **values**, such as numbers, strings, or dates.  
There is no standard way to encode more complex types such as collections (e.g. `Vec<T>`, tuples) in a route parameter.
As a result, Pavex doesn't support them.

Pavex will do its best to catch unsupported types at compile time, but it's not always possible.

## Avoiding allocations

If you want to squeeze out the last bit of performance from your application,
you can try to avoid heap memory allocations when extracting string-like path parameters.  
Pavex supports this use case—**you can borrow from the request's path**.

### Percent-encoding

It is not always possible to avoid allocations when handling path parameters.  
Path parameters must comply with the restriction of the URI specification:
you can only use [a limited set of characters](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2).  
If you want to use a character not allowed in a URI, you must [percent-encode it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding).  
For example, if you want to use a space in a route parameter, you must encode it as `%20`.
A string like `John Doe` becomes `John%20Doe` when percent-encoded.

[`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] automatically decodes percent-encoded strings for you. But that comes at a cost:
Pavex _must_ allocate a new `String` if the route parameter is percent-encoded.

### Cow

We recommend using [`Cow<'_, str>`][Cow] as your field type for string-like parameters.
It borrows from the request's path if possible, it allocates a new `String` if it can't be avoided.

[`Cow<'_, str>`][Cow] strikes a balance between performance and robustness: you don't have to worry about a runtime error if the route parameter
is percent-encoded, but you tried to use `&str` as its field type.

## `RawPathParams`

[`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] is a high-level interface: it bundles together compile-time checks,
extraction and parsing.  
If you want to opt out of all those utilities, reach for [`RawPathParams`][RawPathParams].  
It is a lower-level interface[^relationship]: it gives you access to the dynamic
path segments as they appear right after extraction.
It doesn't perform percent-decoding not deserialization.

### Injection

[`RawPathParams`][RawPathParams] is a [framework primitive](../../dependency_injection/core_concepts/framework_primitives.md),
you don't have to register a constructor to inject it.

--8<-- "doc_examples/guide/request_data/route_params/project-raw_route_params.snap"

### Allocations

[`RawPathParams`][RawPathParams] tries to avoid heap memory allocations.  
Parameter names are borrowed from the server routing machinery.  
Parameter values are borrowed from the [raw path](index.md) of the incoming request. 

You might have to allocate when you decode [percent-encoded parameters](#percent-encoding).

[^why-struct]: Pavex made a deliberate choice of _not_ supporting tuples or other sequence-like types for extracting path parameters.
Check out [the API reference](../../../api_reference/pavex/request/path/struct.PathParams.html#unsupported-types)
to learn more about the rationale behind this decision.

[^wrong-name]: If a field name doesn't match a route parameter name, Pavex will detect it at compile time and return
an error.
No more runtime errors because you misspelled a field name!

[^structural-deserialize]: Check the documentation for [`StructuralDeserialize`][StructuralDeserialize] if you want
to know more about the underlying mechanism.

[^relationship]: [`PathParams<T>`][PathParams] is built on top of [`RawPathParams`][RawPathParams].
