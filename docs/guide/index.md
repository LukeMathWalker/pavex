# Guide

This is the official guide for Pavex.\
It is organised by topic. Each section focuses on one aspect of the framework
(e.g. routing, middlewares, etc.), with examples and code snippets.
It's the **best place to build a mental model of the framework** and learn how to wield it effectively.

No time to waste: use the sidebar to jump to whatever topic you're interested in!\
If you don't know where to start, head over to ["Project structure"](project_structure.md) and go from there.

## Other resources

If you've never used Pavex before,
consider going through the ["Getting started"](../getting_started/index.md) section first.\
If you're looking for the nitty-gritty details of all the types and functions exposed by the framework,
check out the ["API Reference"](../api_reference/pavex/index.html) section instead.
