# Going further

Your first (guided) tour of Pavex ends here: you've touched the key concepts of the framework and got some hands-on
experience with a basic application.\
From here onwards, you are free to carve out your own learning path: you can explore the rest of the documentation
to learn more about the framework, or you can start hacking on your own project, consulting the documentation on a
need-to-know basis.
