# Learning Paths

Each person has a different background and different goals.\
To accommodate this diversity, this section provides multiple learning paths for Pavex, each tailored to a specific audience.

## I know some Rust, but I'm new to Pavex

If you're already familiar with Rust, you can start learning about Pavex right away: head over to our
[Quickstart tutorial](quickstart/index.md) to learn about the core concepts of the framework.

## I'm new to Rust

If you're new to Rust, you should start by learning the language.

### Books

The [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a great place to start: it'll teach you the basics of the
language and the tooling.\
You don't need to read it all at once: the first 11 chapters are enough to get you started.
You can always come back to it later to learn more advanced topics on a need-to-know basis.

### Exercises

If books aren't your thing (or if you want to augment the theory with some practice), you should check out the
[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) project:
it's a collection of small exercises to get the language going under your fingers.
Each exercise is self-contained, can be completed in a few minutes and comes with tests to check your solution.\
In a similar vein, you can also check out the Rust track on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust).

Once you feel comfortable enough with the language, you can start learning about Pavex: head over to the next section!
