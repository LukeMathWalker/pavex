# Welcome

Hey there!  
This is the documentation for **Pavex**, a framework for building APIs in **Rust**.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Pavex, head over to the ["Getting started"](../getting_started/index.md) section.  
It'll walk you through the process of setting up a new Pavex project from scratch.
You'll learn how to install the required tools, how to create a new project, and how to run it.

If you're not sure whether Pavex is the right choice for your project,
check out the ["Why Pavex?"](why_pavex.md) section for a high-level overview of the framework's
design goals and features.

## Going Deeper

Are you already hacking on a Pavex project?  
Get familiar with the ["Guide"](../guide/index.md) and the ["API Reference"](../api_reference/pavex/index.html) sections!

The ["Guide"](../guide/index.md) is organised by topic. Each section focuses on one aspect of the framework
(e.g. routing, middlewares, etc.), with examples and code snippets. 
It's the best place to build a mental model of the framework and learn how to wield it effectively.

The ["API Reference"](../api_reference/pavex/index.html), instead, contains the auto-generated
documentation for all the first-party crates in the Pavex ecosystem.  
It's your go-to place for the nitty-gritty details of all the types and functions
exposed by the framework. It's the same documentation shown in your IDE when you hover over a type or function.
