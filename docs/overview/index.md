# Welcome

Hey there!  
This is the documentation for **Pavex**, a framework for building APIs in **Rust**.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Pavex, head over to the ["Getting started"](../getting_started/index.md) section.  
It'll walk you through the process of setting up a new Pavex project from scratch:
you'll learn how to install the required tools, how to create a new project, and how to run it.

If you're not sure whether Pavex is the right choice for your project,
check out the ["Why Pavex?"](why_pavex.md) section: it'll give you a high-level overview of the framework's
design goals and features.

## Going Further

### Guides

Are you already hacking on a Pavex project?  
The ["Guides"](../guides/index.md) section contains a collection of how-to guides to help you with common tasks
(e.g. integration testing, configuration, etc.).

### Concepts

Guides are task-oriented: their objective is to help you achieve a specific goal, not to teach you a concept.
They're a pragmatic way to get things done, but, over time, you might want to deepen your understanding of the
framework.
That's where the ["Concepts"](../concepts/index.md) section comes in: it contains a collection of articles that explain
the core concepts of the framework in detail (e.g. dependency injection, project structure, etc.).

### API Reference

Last but not least, the ["API Reference"](../api_reference/pavex/index.html) section contains the auto-generated
documentation
for all the first-party crates in the Pavex ecosystem.  
It'll be your go-to place for all things API-related: you'll find detailed documentation for all the types and functions
exposed by the framework.  
It's the same documentation shown in your IDE when you hover over a type or function.
