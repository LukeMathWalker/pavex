## What is Pavex?

Pavex is a new framework to build APIs with Rust.  

Pavex aims to have it all: great ergonomics and high performance.   
The same **productivity boost** of Ruby on Rails, Spring or ASP.NET Core.  
As **fast** as a handwritten solution that strips away all abstractions.

Check out [Pavex's documentation](https://pavex.dev/docs/) for a thorough introduction to the framework
and its design philosophy.

## Project status

Pavex is currently in **closed beta**â€”you can sign up [here](https://pavex.dev) to get early access.

We regularly publish project updates.
