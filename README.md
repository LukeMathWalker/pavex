# `pavex`

> We want it all: great ergonomics and high performance—no sacrifices.

## What is `pavex`?

`pavex` is a source code generator for building APIs and web applications with Rust.  
It takes as input a high-level description of what your application should do.
It generates as output the source code for a fully-fleshed web-server, behaving according to your specification, ready
to be launched.

It aims to deliver **high performance** _as well as_ an **amazing developer experience**.

Check out the [announcement blog post](https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/a-taste-of-pavex-rust-web-framework/) for more
details on the vision.

You can see `pavex` at work in the [`/examples` folder](./examples):

- In [`examples/app_blueprint/src/lib.rs`](./examples/app_blueprint/src/lib.rs) we specify the app's behavior in
  a `Blueprint`—
  the endpoints it exposes and their request handlers, as well as the required constructors for the application state;
- In [`examples/app_blueprint/src/bin.rs`](./examples/app_blueprint/src/bin.rs) we serialize the `Blueprint` and
  invoke `pavex`'s CLI to generate the server code that will execute at runtime, which you can find in
  [`examples/generated_app/src/lib.rs`](./examples/generated_app/src/lib.rs).

In [`examples/app_blueprint/blueprint.ron`](./examples/app_blueprint/blueprint.ron) you can have a peek at what
the `Blueprint` looks like when serialized.

## Project status

`pavex` is under active development and far from being ready for hobby or production usage.  
It has not yet been released on crates.io and you can expect breaking changes on every commit to the `main` branch.

We publish project updates every 4-6 weeks:

- [Progress report #1](https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/pavex-progress-report-01/) [January 2023]
- [Progress report #2](https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/pavex-progress-report-02/) [March 2023]

## Why does `pavex` exist?
