## [0.2.2](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.2.1...0.2.2) - 2025-03-22

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Features

- Use the default session configuration if the user hasn't specified one, rather than
  throwing an error.

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.80...0.2.1) - 2025-03-22

### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Breaking changes

- A complete revamp of the dependency injection system, using annotations and imports
  rather than manually specified paths. Check out the updated guide on [pavex.dev](https://pavex.dev/docs/guide/attributes/)
  for a thorough overview of the new system.
- `Response` and `IntoResponse` are now top-level items in the `pavex` crate.

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Features

- It is no longer necessary to specify an error handler for every single error type. Check
  out the guide [on error fallbacks](https://pavex.dev/docs/guide/errors/error_handlers/#fallback-error-handler)
  for more details.
- There is a new backend for HTTP sessions built on top of SQLite (by @oliverbarnes) - #497

## [0.1.80](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.79...0.1.80) - 2025-03-22

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Always check if pavexc dependencies are installed (by @LukeMathWalker) - #475
- Fix the path to the configuration folder in the Dockerfile of the starter project (by @LukeMathWalker) - #475

## [0.1.79](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.78...0.1.79) - 2025-03-14

### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Breaking changes

- `pavex::time` now re-exports `jiff@0.2` instead of `time@0.3` (by @LukeMathWalker) - #470

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Features

- Configuration is now a first-class concept for Pavex (by @LukeMathWalker) - #469

  Check out the new [configuration guide](https://pavex.dev/docs/guide/configuration/)
  to see how the new configuration system can be used to simplify your project and
  cut down the boilerplate that was previously required to work with configuration values.

## [0.1.78](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.77...0.1.78) - 2025-03-01

### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Breaking changes

- Finalize the API for `pavex_session`, the HTTP session implementation for Pavex.

  The previous API gave equal standing to client-side and server-side state manipulation,
  while the latter is to be preferred and likely to be more widely used.
  This change moves all server-related method to appear directly on the `Session`
  type, while client-side method remain on dedicated accessors.
  Capabilities are unchanged, but the user-experience should be more pleasant.

## [0.1.69](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.68...0.1.69) - 2025-01-21

### Added

- When Pavex's Server fails to spawn a worker thread, capture that thread's name in the error message
- Add Server::try_serve to give users a chance to handle the case where no connection sources have been registered
- Cache accesses for path dependencies are now significantly faster, since 'cargo' is no longer in the hot path of determining the crate checksum
- Reduce the time spent generating JSON docs by leveraging 'cargo rustdoc' built-in caching mechanism for the single-crate usecase.
- Update Pavex's nightly to 2025-01-04. It unlocks the 2024 edition for Pavex users
- Enable backtraces for panics in the project template, being careful not to capture backtraces for normal errors in libraries such as anyhow. Update the command to force the toolchain install to work with the latest rustup version

### Fixed

- Use hyper_util's GracefulShutdown utility to ensure connections are indeed shut down gracefully
- Don't panic if we fail to serve a connection. Log the error as a warning.
- Lower the logging level to info when reporting a failure to establish a connection. This event kind is common enough not to deserve a higher logging level.
- Use the blueprint location as the project fingerprint rather than the workspace path, since a workspace may contain multiple blueprints, as it happens for Pavex's UI tests

### Other

- Migrate all tracing events that touch errors to `log_error!` to ensure consistent field naming
- Clarify why it's fine to panic if `tokio` can't create a current-thread runtime inside a Pavex server worker thread
- Improve suggested resolution for a missing nightly toolchain
- Re-export error-related fields in `pavex_tracing` from `tracing_log_error`
- Update dependency versions

## [0.1.68](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.67...0.1.68) - 2025-01-05

### Fixed

- Don't panic when using a non-specific error handler for a generic constructor

## [0.1.66](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.65...0.1.66) - 2024-12-31

### Other

- update Cargo.toml dependencies

## [0.1.65](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.64...0.1.65) - 2024-12-31

### Other

- Pavex will rely on Rust's coercion rule when a & is required but only a &mut is bound (#404)

## [0.1.64](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.63...0.1.64) - 2024-12-30

### Fixed

- Pavex no longer returns a borrow checker error when a &mut reference must be coerced to a shared reference (#401)

## [0.1.63](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.62...0.1.63) - 2024-12-21

### Fixed

- Execute post-processing middlewares when a pre-processing middleware returns early or fails ([#398](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/398))

## [0.1.62](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.61...0.1.62) - 2024-12-11

### Fixed

- [`pavex_session`] Fix a runtime panic: the server-side state should be loaded if it hasn't been loaded yet.

## [0.1.61](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.60...0.1.61) - 2024-12-11

### Features

- Track which field failed to be deserialized when working with query parameters

### Other

- [Breaking] Rework `pavex_session::Session` to avoid requiring a `&mut` reference when performing read operations ([#389](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/389))

## [0.1.59](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.58...0.1.59) - 2024-12-01

### Fixed

- Disable default features for server SDK's dependencies ([#386](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/386))

## [0.1.58](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.57...0.1.58) - 2024-11-29

## [0.1.57](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.56...0.1.57) - 2024-11-27

### Fixed

- Pavex won't panic if it can't find a transitive dependency in the package graph. It'll log details about the failed searches.

## [0.1.54](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.53...0.1.54) - 2024-11-26

### Added

- Pavex now supports domain guards!
  You can restrict routes to specific domains and/or serve different websites from the same Pavex application.
  Check out [the relevant guide](https://pavex.dev/docs/guide/routing/domain_guards/) for more information.
- There is now a [dedicated guide](https://pavex.dev/docs/guide/routing/path_prefixes/) explaining how common
  path prefixes work.

### Breaking ‚ö†Ô∏è

- `Blueprint::nest_at` has been removed. Use `Blueprint::prefix("/my_prefix").nest(nested_bp)` as a replacement.
- The syntax for path parameters has changed. Instead of `:param_name`, use `{param_name}`.

## [0.1.53](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.52...0.1.53) - 2024-11-12

### Added

- 'pavex' and 'pavexc' check a dedicated environment variable, in addition to invocation flags, to determine if diagnostic information should be outputted

### Fixed

- Avoid processing the same nodes multiple times in order to avoid duplicated transient nodes.

### Other

- Update `thiserror` to `2.x.y` in generated code

## [0.1.52](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.51...0.1.52) - 2024-11-05

### Fixed

- Don't allow the basic block visitor to simultaneously engage with multiple branching nodes. It fixes a panic for more complex call graphs.

### Other

- Add a span around the generation of the application state initializer function
- Print the call graph for the application state initializer if the log level is set to 'trace'

## [0.1.51](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.50...0.1.51) - 2024-11-05

### Added

- The diagnostic representation of all call graphs now includes call order information‚Äîe.g. does this constructor get invoked before or after this other one?

### Fixed

- Respect the order identified by the borrow-checking analysis phase when generating code

## [0.1.50](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.49...0.1.50) - 2024-11-01

### Added

- Support lifetime parameters in type aliases

### Fixed

- Supply an (empty) instance of `UrlParams` to the root fallback handler, if it needs it.
- Look for the 'impl' block in the crate that define the type, rather than the trait, when resolving trait methods
- Improve error message when we fail to find a method item in the JSON docs
- Don't complain about missing constructors when looking at a naked generic input parameter
- Bind generic parameters correctly in all instances
- Panic eagerly if internal invariants are not upheld when binding generic parameters
- Pavex correctly handles type aliases with generic parameters that differ from the target type
- Pavex will correctly set the name of the defining crate when resolving local type aliases that refer to remote types
- Pavex will never use private modules in the paths used to refer to methods in the generated server SDK code. ([#355](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/355))

### Other

- Improve panic message with details about the `rustdoc` item we couldn't handle
- Display the available constructibles when PAVEX_DEBUG is set and we incur into a 'missing constructor' error
- Display the cyclic dependency graph when PAVEX_DEBUG is set
- Provide an easy-to-examine representation for the set of constructibles in a given scope tree

## [0.1.49](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.48...0.1.49) - 2024-10-23

### Added

- First release of Pavex's HTTP sessions toolkit üéâ ([#338](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/338))
- Distinguish between methods and functions in error messages ([#344](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/344))
- Start caching the JSON documentation of path dependencies. We rely on the hash of their contents to avoid serving stale data
- Pavex will no longer emit duplicated diagnostics, thus reducing visual noise when code generation fails

### Fixed

- Pavex always uses a public path to refer to public items, even if they are defined in a private module
- Detect infinite paths and break early to avoid stalls when generating server SDK crates
- Ensure error observers are correctly added when dealing with errors in the call graph of a middleware of any kind
- Perform cross-call-graph analysis to determine if additional `.clone()` statements are needed before invoking a middleware.
- Don't discard spans if they match the provided log filter in pavexc

### Other

- Update dependencies to latest possible version. In particular, update 'rustdoc-types' and the nightly version used by 'pavexc'

## [0.1.48](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.47...0.1.48) - 2024-09-02

### Fixed

- Avoid panic petgraph-related panic when inserting clone nodes to fix borrow checking errors ([#334](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/334))

## [0.1.47](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.46...0.1.47) - 2024-08-14

### Fixed

- always use the specified toolchain, remove yet another location where nightly was hard-coded

### Other

- Pin a specific `nightly` version for each version of `pavexc`, ensuring they are compatible ([#331](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/331))
- Allow overriding the `nightly` toolchain used to generate JSON docs via `PAVEXC_DOCS_TOOLCHAIN` ([#331](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/331))
- Fix panics when performing dependency injection for complex call graphs ([#329](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/329))

### Fixed

- std's collections can be used as prebuilt types ([#321](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/321))

### Other

- Add constructor for RequestHead ([#319](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/319))

## [0.1.44](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.43...0.1.44) - 2024-06-22

### Fixed

- Don't use public items via paths that include private modules ([#316](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/316))

## [0.1.43](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.42...0.1.43) - 2024-06-19

### Added

- Add status_mut() function to Response ([#313](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/313))

## [0.1.42](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.41...0.1.42) - 2024-06-18

### Fixed

- elided lifetime parameters in generic structs are handled correctly ([#310](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/310))

## [0.1.41](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.40...0.1.41) - 2024-06-16

### Fixed

- Pavex will reject singleton constructors if they return a type with non-`'static` lifetime parameters. Singletons must be shared across worker threads, therefore they must be `'static`.

## [0.1.40](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.39...0.1.40) - 2024-06-16

### Fixed

- 'pavex new' no longer panics if 'cargo fmt' fails. ([#303](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/303))

## [0.1.39](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.38...0.1.39) - 2024-06-15

### Added

- Add a workspace-hack crate to the generated starter project to minimise (re)build times
- Introduce prebuilt types ([#298](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/298))
- Add a new '--template' option to 'pavex new' and 'pavexc new'. It includes a dedicated 'quickstart' template as well as the 'api' template, the default.
- In the starter project, use a meaningful example to showcase how the configuration system works, rather than a dummy with no usage
- Shorthand methods (`.clone_if_necessary()` and `.never_clone()`) to tweak the default cloning strategy on constructors and prebuilt types

### Fixed

- Set new Cargo lint to allow 'cfg(pavex_ide_hint)' in Pavex, its snapshot tests and its scaffolded projects
- Use the [env] section of .cargo/config.toml to store non-sensitive env variables used for local development. It fixes configuration for newly generated projects.
- Don't use colored logs if color is not enabled.
- Include `super` and `self` as valid prefixes for relative paths in error messages ([#296](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/296))
- You can no longer register a type with a non-`'static` lifetime parameter (implicit or explicit) as a singleton. ([#298](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/298))

## [0.1.38](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.37...0.1.38) - 2024-04-28

### Fixed

- anyhow::Result<Self> can be returned from constructors and other fallible components ([#293](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/293))

## [0.1.37](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.36...0.1.37) - 2024-04-27

### Fixed

- Interpolate error message when failing to download a prebuilt `pavexc` binary
- Remove dependency on OpenSSL on Linux

## [0.1.36](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.35...0.1.36) - 2024-04-27

### Fixed

- Use the correct name for package names that contain hyphens in the (generated) server SDK Cargo.toml ([#287](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/287))
  For example, `sqlx-query` used to be renamed to `sqlx_query` in the generated `Cargo.toml`, causing a `cargo` error.

### Other

- Update dependencies ([#285](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/285))
- Activation keys are now validated server-side ([#283](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/283))

## [0.1.35](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.34...0.1.35) - 2024-04-26

### Fixed

- Allow &mut references to be held by Next's state. ([#280](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/280))

## [0.1.34](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.33...0.1.34) - 2024-04-25

### Fixes

- Use Unix path separator in Cargo.toml manifests when specifying path dependencies ([#275](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/275))
  It allows the same Pavex project to be built on all platforms with no changes.
- Re-add default .env file ([#276](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/276))
  It allows `cargo px r` to "just work" on a newly scaffolded Pavex project.

### Other

- Re-order Cargo.toml file ([#277](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/277))

## [0.1.33](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.32...0.1.33) - 2024-04-21

### Added

- Server request id is now represented as a TypeId ([#272](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/pull/272))

## [0.1.31](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/compare/0.1.30...0.1.31) - 2024-04-21
